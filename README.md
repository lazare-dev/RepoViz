# RepoViz

RepoViz is a visualization tool designed to analyze and visualize the structure of software repositories. It seamlessly integrates multiple language parsers and provides an interactive graph representation of the repository's components, such as classes, functions, and relationships between them.

## Features

- **Repository Cloning:** Automatically clones repositories for analysis using provided URL, username, and access tokens.
- **Language Detection:** Employs `go-enry` to detect programming languages used within the repository, aiding in tailored analysis.
- **Graph Generation:** Constructs a comprehensive graph detailing the components of the repository and their interconnections.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Utilizes `vis-network` for dynamic and interactive graph visualization within a web interface.

## Backend

The backend component is responsible for the analysis and data processing part of RepoViz. It includes:

- **Repository Cloning:** (`cloneRepo.go`) Clones the target repository to a local directory for analysis.
- **Language Detection:** (`detectLanguage.go`) Scans the repository to identify the programming languages used.
- **Graph Construction:** (`graph.go`, `parseGo.go`, `Program.cs`, `parseJS.js`) Parses different programming languages to build a node and edge graph representing the repository's structure.
- **Integration Workflow:** (`integration.go`) Orchestrates the parsing process across different programming languages and integrates their outputs into a unified graph.

## Frontend

The frontend component provides a user-friendly web interface to interact with the visualization generated by the backend. It includes:

- **Graph Visualization:** (`MindMapVisualization.js`) Renders the repository graph using `vis-network`, offering an interactive exploration experience.
- **Data Hook:** (`useGraphData.js`) Manages the loading and state of the graph data for visualization.
- **Styling:** (`App.css`) Ensures a clean and responsive layout for the visualization tool.

## Getting Started

To get started with RepoViz, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the RepoViz repository** to your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies** for both backend and frontend parts:
   - Backend: Navigate to the `api` directory and run `go get` to install Go dependencies.
   - Frontend: Navigate to the `web` directory and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install JavaScript dependencies.
3. **Configure the repository URL** and access credentials in `api/cmd/repoviz/main.go`.
4. **Run the backend server** to start the analysis and graph generation process.
5. **Launch the frontend application** to visualize the analysis results.
